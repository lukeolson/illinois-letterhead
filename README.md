### Illinois Letterhead for iSchool

This repository is an attempt to reproduce the Illinois letterhead for iSchool in Latex. 
<br>
The original code is from <https://github.com/lukeolson/illinois-letterhead>.
<br>
I made the following updates:
- Change the font from Montserrat to Source Sans. This is to match the official Microsoft Word letterhead.
- Update the wordmark and logo to the correct color.
- Add iSchool information.
